# trade-ogre-trader
This is a crypto trading bot that uses the Trade Ogre exchange to place orders and data from Binanace.

SETUP:

I will tell you the simplest way I know:

BE SURE TO HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED!

In your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/JonPizza/trade-ogre-trader
cd trade-ogre-trader
nano (*or whatever text editor you want :p*) trader.py
Set the API keys to your own
(back in terminal) python trader.py
Profit.
```
